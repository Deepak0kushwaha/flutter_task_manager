# Cross‑Platform Task Management App

This repository contains a minimal Flutter application that serves as a
cross‑platform task manager.  The app provides a simple interface for
users to add, remove and mark tasks as complete.  Storage and
state management are left as TODOs so that the structure can be
extended according to your needs.

## Getting Started

1. Install Flutter from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) and set up your
   development environment.
2. Clone this repository and run `flutter pub get` to install
   dependencies.
3. Launch the app with `flutter run` on a simulator or device.

## Features

* Add new tasks through a simple input field.
* Display a list of tasks.
* Mark tasks as completed.
* Persist tasks locally (implementation left as an exercise).

## File Structure

* **lib/main.dart** – Entry point for the Flutter application.
* Additional Dart files can be created under `lib/` as the project
  grows.
